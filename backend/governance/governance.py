"""Governance policy enforcement for ADPF 2.1.

The `Governance` class is responsible for applying platform policies
such as budget limits, safety checks and telemetry requirements before
any agent templates are executed.  For Sprint 1â€“2 the implementation is
minimal: it simply returns a placeholder policy dictionary.  Future
sprints will integrate PII handling, token budgets and other controls.
