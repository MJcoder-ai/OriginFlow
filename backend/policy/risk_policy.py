"""
Risk-based policy engine for OriginFlow governance.

This module implements a simple decision engine that determines whether
an AI action may be automatically approved based on the originating
agent's risk class and the action's confidence score.  Risk classes
(``low``, ``medium`` and ``high``) correspond to escalating levels of
manual oversight:

* ``low`` risk actions are auto-approved regardless of confidence.
* ``medium`` risk actions require a minimum confidence threshold to be
  considered safe; below this threshold a human should review the action.
* ``high`` risk actions always require human approval; no amount of
  confidence can bypass review.

Future implementations may load thresholds and policies from configuration
or per-tenant settings.  See the PhaseÂ 8 documentation for details.
