"""ODL Graph and Planning API routes.

This FastAPI router exposes endpoints for interacting with the
OriginFlow Design Language (ODL) graphs and for generating
high-level plans via the ``PlannerAgent``.  Clients can create
and manage per-session graphs, apply patches, retrieve the current
state, and request a plan for a given natural language command.

These endpoints form the backbone of the planâ€“act loop that
enables sophisticated multi-domain design interactions.  They are
stateless with respect to authentication; session identifiers must
be provided by the client and may map to user or project IDs in
a higher level service.
