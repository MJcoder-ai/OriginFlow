# backend/api/routes/compatibility.py
"""API routes for compatibility validation.

This module defines a FastAPI router that exposes an endpoint for
validating design snapshots using the :class:`CompatibilityEngine`.
It accepts a ``DesignSnapshot`` payload and returns a
``CompatibilityReport`` summarising any issues found.  At present the
compatibility engine is a stub that always reports no issues, but this
API can be integrated immediately to test the wiring and future rule
logic.

Endpoint summary:

* **POST /api/v1/ai/validate-compatibility** â€“ Accepts a
  ``DesignSnapshot`` body and returns a ``CompatibilityReport``.

To enable this route, import the router from
``backend.api.routes.compatibility`` and include it in the FastAPI
application using ``app.include_router``.
