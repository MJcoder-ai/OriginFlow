"""Pure domain tools for OriginFlow (Phase 3).

These modules expose deterministic logic that operate on small slices of ODL
state and return :class:`ODLPatch` objects.  They intentionally avoid direct
access to databases or global stores.  The orchestrator is responsible for
composing tools and applying the resulting patches.
