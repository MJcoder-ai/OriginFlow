"""Domain calculation engines.

This module provides skeleton implementations of domainâ€‘specific
calculation engines for PV, HVAC and water pumping systems.  These
engines compute sizing and performance parameters based on user
requirements and the current design snapshot.  At present, they
provide only basic or placeholder calculations; future versions
should integrate detailed models and real component parameters.

Usage::

    from backend.services.calculation_engines import PVCalculationEngine
    engine = PVCalculationEngine()
    result = await engine.compute(requirements, snapshot)
    print(result['panel_count'])  # e.g. number of panels needed
