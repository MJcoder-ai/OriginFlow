# backend/services/compatibility.py
"""Compatibility validation service for OriginFlow.

This module defines a skeleton implementation of a multi-domain
compatibility engine.  A future version will perform electrical,
mechanical, thermal and communication rule checks across all
components and connections in a design.  For now it provides a
scaffold that always returns successful validation results, allowing
the API and calling code to be integrated without blocking on rule
implementation.

The compatibility engine operates on a ``DesignSnapshot``, converting
the graph into a component map and connection list.  Each category
of rules is encapsulated in its own class, enabling targeted
validation and easy extension in future releases.
