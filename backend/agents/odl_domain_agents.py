"""Domain agents for OriginFlow Design Language (ODL) graphs.

This module defines a collection of lightweight domain agents that
operate over ODL graphs.  Each agent encapsulates a particular
engineering domain (e.g. PV design, wiring, structural analysis,
communications, assemblies) and exposes a unified ``execute`` method
which accepts a task identifier and the current graph snapshot.  The
method returns a patch describing changes to apply to the graph and an
optional ``DesignCard`` summarising the suggestion for the user.

These classes provide scaffolding for future implementations.  They
contain only stub logic at present, returning empty patches and no
cards.  In a production environment each agent would perform
detailed calculations, consult domain rules and standards, and
populate rich cards with images, specifications and actionable
commands.
