"""Simple metrics collection utilities.

The ``MetricsCollector`` class provides a lightweight mechanism for
recording and summarising quantitative observations during
execution.  Each metric is identified by a string name.  Metrics
can be recorded either as discrete values (via ``record``) or as
timings (via ``start_timer``/``stop_timer``).  For each metric the
collector maintains the number of samples, the sum of the values,
the minimum and maximum recorded value, and computes the average
upon summarisation.

This implementation is intentionally minimalist: it does not
support histograms, percentiles or exporting to external
monitoring systems.  Future iterations may integrate with
OpenTelemetry or other observability backends.

    observed values.  Timings can be recorded using ``start_timer``
    and ``stop_timer`` which compute the elapsed time between
