"""Top-level package for domain packs.

Domain packs store versioned, domain-specific knowledge such as
ontologies, formulas, constraints, component catalogs and examples.
Creating this ``__init__`` file makes the ``domain_packs`` folder a
Python package so its submodules can be imported dynamically by the
domain pack loader.
