## Workflow Implementation

### 1. Placeholder-First Design Flow

Wiring Design → Component Selection → Real Component Integration → 
Final Validation
```

**Key Features**:
- Start designing immediately without component datasheets
- Complete functional design with placeholders
- Gradual replacement as real components become available
- Maintain design connectivity throughout process

### ADPF Integration (Phase 7)

As part of adopting the **Advanced Dynamic Prompting Framework (ADPF)**, all AI agents now return their results in a standard JSON envelope.  The envelope includes:

- **thought** – a short string describing the agent’s internal reasoning and why it produced a particular output.
- **output** – a structured object containing the original `card` and `patch` fields produced by the agent.
- **status** – the outcome of the task (`pending`, `blocked` or `complete`).
- **warnings** – optional list of warnings.

This change provides traceability and meta‑cognitive context for every AI action, making it easier for downstream components (UI, orchestrator or other agents) to interpret agent outputs.  A new helper function `wrap_response` in `backend/utils/adpf.py` centralises envelope creation and should be used by all agents.

### Governance & Safety Policies (Phase 8)

As part of the move toward enterprise‑grade robustness, OriginFlow now enforces **risk‑based governance** for all AI actions.  Every agent declares its ``risk_class`` (``low``, ``medium`` or ``high``) in the registry via `register_spec`.  A new policy engine (`backend/policy/risk_policy.py`) consults these classes together with the confidence scores assigned by the learning system to decide whether each action may be automatically executed or must be deferred for user review.

The high‑level rules are:

- **Low‑risk actions**: Always auto‑approved (e.g. generating placeholder design scaffolds).
- **Medium‑risk actions**: Auto‑approved only if confidence is ≥ 0.75; otherwise they require explicit user approval.
- **High‑risk actions**: Never auto‑approved; they always require manual confirmation.

The AI orchestrators (`Orchestrator` and `AnalyzeOrchestrator`) apply this policy per action, setting an `auto_approved` flag accordingly.  The frontend surface highlights actions requiring attention and prevents accidental execution of high‑risk operations.  These governance policies lay the groundwork for future safety rules such as budget limits, restricted topics and regulatory compliance checks.

### 2. Component-First Design Flow

### Compliance & Rule Engine (Phase 9)

To strengthen the engineering rigour of OriginFlow, Phase 9 introduces a
more robust compliance layer across both deterministic calculations and
agent-driven validation.

- **Expanded Rule Engine**: The deterministic `RuleEngine` now provides
  a `validate_wire` method that checks whether an installed wire and fuse
  meet recommended standards for a given load and distance.  The method
  returns a rich `WireValidation` object containing the installed and
  recommended conductor sizes, fuse ratings, calculated current and
  voltage drop, and boolean flags indicating compliance with cross‑section,
  fuse sizing and voltage‑drop limits.
- **Cross‑Layer Connectivity Checks**: The `cross_layer_validation_agent` has
  been upgraded to parse the design snapshot passed by the orchestrator.
  It counts connections for each component and reports any unconnected
  components via a validation action.  This helps catch incomplete designs
  early and lays the groundwork for more sophisticated cross‑layer
  consistency checks in future phases.

### Extended Multi‑Domain Support (Phase 10)

Phase 10 expands OriginFlow beyond the solar domain by introducing new domain
agents for battery storage and system monitoring.  The PlannerAgent now emits
``generate_battery`` and ``generate_monitoring`` tasks when a PV design
requires energy storage or telemetry.  The new agents operate as follows:

- **BatteryAgent**: Automatically sizes and places placeholder battery
  modules in the design.  It examines the current graph, locates inverters,
  creates generic battery nodes and connects them via electrical links.  The
  agent produces a design card summarising the number of modules added and
  recommended next steps.
- **MonitoringAgent**: Adds placeholder monitoring devices to instrument
  inverters and batteries.  For each component requiring telemetry, it
  creates a generic monitoring node and connects it with communication links.
  If no specific targets exist, it attaches a device to the system root.
  The resulting card outlines the instrumented components and follow‑on
  actions.

Both agents return ADPF‑compliant envelopes and are registered with risk
classes (medium for battery, low for monitoring) to allow the governance
layer to gate their actions appropriately.

### Observability & Learning (Phase 11)

To operate safely at scale, OriginFlow now exposes a **telemetry layer** and lays
the groundwork for continuous learning:

- **Observability utilities**: A new module (`backend/utils/observability.py`)
  introduces `trace_span` and `record_metric`, lightweight wrappers for
  measuring execution latency and recording arbitrary counters.  These
  utilities log metrics using a dedicated logger (`originflow.observability`),
  enabling easy integration with existing monitoring stacks.
- **Instrumented orchestrators**: The AI orchestrators now wrap action
  validation and risk‑based approval loops in timed spans and emit metrics
  for each processed action and auto‑approval decision.  This provides
  visibility into throughput, latency and approval rates, which can be used
  to tune performance and detect regressions.
- **Metrics for approvals**: Both `Orchestrator` and `AnalyzeOrchestrator`
  record the number of processed actions and the subset automatically
  approved.  Confidence scores are logged with each decision, enabling
  calibration analysis.

This phase does not yet include a full ML‑powered feedback loop, but lays
the foundation for adaptive learning by exposing rich telemetry that can be
consumed by future calibrators.  Subsequent releases will add retrieval‑
augmented feedback and dynamic adjustment of agent confidence thresholds.

### Error Handling & Concurrency (Phase 12)

The final phase in the Phase 1 roadmap addresses robustness in the face of
failures and concurrent access:

- **Custom error types**: A new `backend/utils/errors.py` defines
  `InvalidPatchError`, `DesignConflictError` and `SessionNotFoundError`,
  enabling agents and services to distinguish between invalid inputs,
  conflicting updates and missing sessions.
- **Optimistic concurrency & idempotency**: The graph service now uses per‑session
  locks (`asyncio.Lock`) to prevent concurrent writes from clobbering each
  other.  Patch application skips duplicate nodes/edges and validates
  removals, ensuring idempotent updates and raising descriptive errors on
  conflicts.
- **Safe agent execution**: `AgentBase` provides a `safe_execute` wrapper that
  catches both custom and unexpected errors.  Agents that call `safe_execute`
  return a structured ADPF envelope with an error message and a `blocked`
  status rather than propagating exceptions.
- **Unified error responses**: The AI orchestrators continue to operate on
  validated actions even if some agents fail, and error messages surface
  through design cards rather than HTTP errors.  This improves user
  experience and prevents the system from stalling when a single agent
  misbehaves.

These improvements harden the OriginFlow backend against runtime errors and
race conditions, paving the way for further concurrency enhancements in
future releases (e.g. using a workflow engine like Temporal or a saga
pattern for rollback).

### Sagas & Workflow Engine (Phase 13)

Complex multi-agent operations require transactional guarantees across many
graph mutations. The new saga-style workflow engine provides these guarantees
without long-lived locks:

- **Workflow engine**: `backend/services/workflow_engine.py` defines a
  `WorkflowEngine` that runs ordered `SagaStep` instances. Each step returns an
  `ODLGraphPatch` applied to the design graph. If any step fails, previously
  applied patches are rolled back in reverse order automatically.
- **Reverse patches**: `ODLGraphPatch` gains a `reverse` method to generate a
  compensating patch removing nodes and edges added by a step. Custom
  compensation functions remain possible for more complex scenarios.
- **Extensibility**: While lightweight today, the engine sets the stage for
  integrating external orchestrators such as Temporal.io in future phases.

This addition allows OriginFlow to maintain graph consistency across long
design sequences, significantly improving robustness for real-world workflows.
### Enhanced Rule Engine (Phase 14)

In this phase, the deterministic rule engine has been extended beyond wire
sizing to cover conduit sizing and structural mount load calculations.  These
additional checks provide stronger compliance with NEC/IEC codes and help
engineers design safe, compliant PV installations across multiple domains.

- **Conduit sizing**: `RuleEngine.size_conduit` computes the required
  conduit cross‑section and diameter based on the total cross-section of
  conductors and an allowable fill factor.  `validate_conduit` checks an
  installed conduit against these recommendations, returning a fill ratio and
  compliance flag.
- **Mount load sizing**: `size_mount_load` estimates the minimum required
  load capacity for panel mounts based on the number of panels, panel
  weight and a wind load factor.  `validate_mount` compares installed mount
  capacity to the recommended value and reports compliance.

These enhancements lay the groundwork for future deterministic rules—such as
battery pack configurations and lightning protection sizing—bringing
OriginFlow closer to full NEC/IEC compliance across all domains.
