# **OriginFlow Platform Agent Taxonomy (v2.0)**

*Updated July 28, 2025: Refined based on 2025 industry insights from Gartner (agentic AI for autonomous workflows), LangChain (multi-agent orchestration patterns), and real-world examples (e.g., AI agents in sales from Tredence and supply chain from MobiDev). Fixed OCR errors, ensured single responsibility per playbook, added event-based I/O for loose coupling, incorporated bias guards/ethics in customer-facing agents, and expanded phasing with KPIs. Added agents for emerging needs like predictive maintenance (from arXiv taxonomy) and integrated lifecycle (e.g., blackboard for state sharing). Total agents: 42, organized by 8 lifecycle stages for end-to-end non-physical automation.*

This taxonomy covers the complete OriginFlow platform, from customer acquisition via marketing to end-of-life management. Agents are LLM-based (e.g., Grok-4 for reasoning), registered in a central catalog with Spec Cards (per playbook), and orchestrated via BusinessOrchestratorAgent using event-sourcing (Kafka/Temporal) for resilience. Each agent follows playbook principles: single responsibility (â‰¤3 functions), contract-first (schemas for I/O), explicit tools (e.g., web\_search for leads), and observability (OTEL spans). Dependencies are version-pinned (e.g., v1.x); I/O uses JSON schemas with events for async flows.

## **Guiding Design Principles**

1. **Plug-in Architecture**: Register each agent in a central catalog with declared capabilities, required context, and webhook/schema definitions. Enables hot-swapping (e.g., replace LLM provider).  
2. **Blackboard State**: Use an append-only event store (Kafka) so agents can resume partial jobs, enabling retry, audit, and multi-agent collaboration (per AutoGen 2025 patterns).  
3. **Rule-vs-LLM Split**: Safety-critical tasks (e.g., compliance checks) in RuleEngineService; LLMs for suggestions/explanations (reduces hallucinations by 35% per LangChain benchmarks).  
4. **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)**: Gate high-risk actions (e.g., contracts, disputes) behind explicit user approval; bias\_guard: true for customer-facing agents.  
5. **Ethics & Privacy**: Embed consent checks, log outputs for bias audits (AIF360), and ensure GDPR compliance (e.g., no PII in prompts).
